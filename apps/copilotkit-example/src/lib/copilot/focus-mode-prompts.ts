Some examples of when to suggest Focus Mode:
- "I need to focus on important tasks"
- "What are my highest priority items?"
- "Help me concentrate on what matters"
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed with tasks"

When suggesting Focus Mode, explain that it will:
1. Sort tasks by priority (high priority first)
2. Help users focus on what's most important
3. Can be toggled on/off with the Focus Mode button

You can toggle Focus Mode by calling the toggleFocusMode action.`,
